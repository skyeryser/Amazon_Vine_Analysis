# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to find out if there is a bias toward favorable reviews from paid (Vine) reviewers and unpaid reviewers for luggage products sold on Amazon.

## Results
All of the totals for paid and unpaid reviews below are calculated from a pool of reviews that has a total of 20 votes or more. Of those votes, fifty percent or more have to be classified as 'helpful.' These qualifications ensure that the bucket of reviews used in this project is productive reviews that have helpful information for the consumer.

### Paid Reviews
- The total number of paid luggage reviews was 932
- The total number of 5-star reviews from Vine reviewers was 518
- The percentage of paid 5-star reviews to paid reviews is 55.6%


### Unpaid Reviews
- The total number of unpaid luggage reviews was 387,919
- The total number of 5-star reviews from unpaid reviewers was 210,647
- The percentage of unpaid 5-star reviews to unpaid reviews is 54.3%


## Summary
Based on the results presented above, the percentage of 5-star reviews between the paid and unpaid reviewers on Amazon is similar. It doesn't appear that paid reviewers are much more likely to review a product highly just because they have been incentivized to write the review. Likewise, it can be argued that unpaid reviewers write more high-quality reviews than their paid counterparts. If luggage products have so many unpaid reviewers, what is the point in paying for more reviews?
To delve further into this question, the next step would be to see if there is a benefit to paying for reviews immediately after a product has been launched to entice new customers to buy the product that they may not recognize. One way to find out is to see if the concentration of paid reviews is higher for products that are reviewed less. It's possible that as a product becomes more popular, unpaid reviewers are more likely to jump on board with a review than if a product is unknown or doesn't have a lot of reviews posted on Amazon.
